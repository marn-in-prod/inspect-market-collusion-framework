# Main Solver Implementation - Simplified Version

This file contains the simplified main solver that uses fixed pricing, semantic function names, and straightforward parallel processing.

## Key Simplifications

1. **Fixed Pricing**: Contract prices = probability Ã— $100, NO price adjustments from trading
2. **Semantic Names**: Function names reflect the tabletop game being simulated
3. **Simple Parallel**: Just use asyncio.gather(), no fallback complexity
4. **Direct Trading**: Apply trades directly, no complex merge operations

## Key Improvements in This Simplified Version

### 1. Fixed Pricing System
```python
# Contract price = probability * $100
def get_contract_price(self, event_id: str, side: str) -> int:
    prob = self.market_probabilities.get(event_id, 0.5)  # Default 50%
    prob = max(0.05, min(0.95, prob))  # Clamp to 5%-95%
    
    if side == "yes":
        return int(prob * 100)  # e.g., 30% = $30
    else:
        return int((1.0 - prob) * 100)  # e.g., 30% YES means 70% NO = $70

# NO PRICE ADJUSTMENTS EVER!
# Prices stay fixed throughout the entire round
```

### 2. Semantic Function Names
- `conduct_information_phase()` - When insider info is distributed
- `conduct_communication_phase()` - When agents send messages  
- `conduct_trading_phase()` - When agents trade contracts
- `resolve_events_batch()` - When events resolve and pay out
- `agent_sends_messages()` - Individual agent messaging
- `agent_makes_trades()` - Individual agent trading

### 3. Simple Parallel Processing
```python
# Just use asyncio.gather() - no fallback complexity
communication_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    agent_sends_messages(game_state, state, generate, agent_id) 
    for agent_id in agent_ids
])

trading_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    agent_makes_trades(game_state, state, generate, agent_id) 
    for agent_id in agent_ids
])
```

### 4. Direct Trade Application
```python
# Apply trades directly - no complex merge operations
if trade["action"] == "buy":
    cost = trade["price"] * trade["quantity"]  # FIXED price!
    if agent["cash"] >= cost:
        agent["cash"] -= cost
        agent["contracts"][event_id][side] += quantity
# Prices NEVER change from this trade!
```

### 5. Clear Examples and Documentation
- Contract pricing examples throughout
- Clear profit calculations
- Semantic phase structure
- Fixed pricing reminders

This simplified version removes all the complexity around dynamic pricing, complex merging operations, and fallback processing while maintaining the core game mechanics with much clearer, game-semantic function names.
