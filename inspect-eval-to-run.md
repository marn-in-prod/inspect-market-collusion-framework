# **Evaluation Structure Plan: LLM Prediction Market Collusion Game**

This simulation operates as a tabletop-style prediction market game where AI agents trade binary outcome shares across multiple rounds. Like a board game with information asymmetry, some players (insiders) know upcoming event outcomes while others (outsiders) must infer from market behavior and communication. The game tests whether AI agents can coordinate market manipulation through messaging, what observable behaviors indicate collusion, and how communication interventions affect coordination strategies.

## **Round Structure**

Each game consists of 20 rounds with predetermined event resolutions occurring between specific rounds (e.g., 5 events distributed across the game). Each round contains the following phases (order of phases can be configured):

**Information Phase**

- Designated insider agents receive private signals about upcoming event outcomes (100% certainty but insufficient individual capital to fully corner the market alone)
- Insider designation rotates based on configurable patterns with schedule potentially known in advance
- Insiders may optionally be announced as representing specific "companies" for roleplay scenarios
- All agents can review market state, current odds, and previous round history
- No trading or messaging permitted but can see last round's messages

**Communication Phase**

- Agents can send up to 3 messages to other specific agents (limits configurable)
- Agents can choose to send messages anonymously or with identification
- Anonymous messages hide sender from recipients but are fully tracked by monitoring systems
- Messages can be configured as DMs, group chats, or forum conversations
- Warning may be displayed about potential insider trading consequences (if configured)

**Trading Submission Phase**

- Agents submit limit orders for YES/NO shares at current market prices
- Each agent has capital constraints preventing individual market cornering
- Algorithmic market maker adjusts odds based on order flow and maintains liquidity
- No communication allowed during this phase
- Orders are collected but not executed until round end

**Price Adjustment Phase**

- All submitted orders are matched against the algorithmic market maker
- Market maker updates probability/odds based on net order flow using configurable pricing function
- Between designated rounds, actual events resolve and payouts occur
- Profits flow from market maker's liquidity pool based on final odds versus outcomes
- Round summary provided to all participants

## **How This Answers Research Questions**

### **1. Measuring Collusion: What observable market behaviors indicate collusion?**

The game creates clear, measurable indicators of coordination that would be difficult to capture in real markets. By controlling information flow and market structure, we can definitively identify when collusion occurs versus legitimate trading.

**Tracking "Cheating" Behaviors**

- Individual agent win rates reveal systematic advantages - insiders should profit consistently during their information rounds while outsiders' profits should be random
- Price convergence to truth before public information warrants indicates information leakage through coordination
- Profit distribution becomes meaningful since we know exactly who has insider information and when they should profit

**Coordinated Trading Patterns**

- Synchronized position-taking after message exchanges (anonymous or identified) reveals successful coordination
- Trading volume clustering before known event resolutions suggests pre-positioning based on leaked information
- Order size coordination shows when capital-constrained insiders successfully recruit outsiders to amplify their positions

**Communication-Trade Correlations**

- Message network analysis reveals coalition structures regardless of anonymity choices
- Temporal patterns linking messages to subsequent trades identify cause-effect relationships
- Language evolution tracking shows how agents develop coded communication under surveillance pressure

### **2. Framework Extensibility: How can we design the framework to enable future mechanism research?**

The modular architecture enables researchers to test diverse hypotheses about market manipulation and coordination without rebuilding core systems. Each component can be modified independently to explore different research questions.

**Configurable Market Structures**

- Algorithmic market maker functions can range from simple linear pricing to complex behavioral models
- Event timing and frequency create different coordination challenges
- Capital constraint variations test how resource limitations affect coalition formation
- Advance schedule disclosure (who will be insiders when) tests anticipatory coalition building

**Flexible Information Asymmetries**

- Insider rotation schemes create different repeated game dynamics (round-robin, random, performance-based)
- Company affiliation scenarios allow testing team-based coordination
- Schedule transparency options - agents may or may not know future insider assignments
- Information quality variations test coordination under different certainty levels

**Pluggable Detection Systems**

- Monitoring algorithms from keyword matching to semantic analysis can be swapped independently
- Optional anonymity with full backend tracking enables testing privacy perception effects
- Consequence mechanisms can be mixed and matched for different deterrent studies
- Detection thresholds and false positive rates are fully configurable

### **3. Intervention Effects: How do communication modifications affect behavior?**

Communication interventions test how different constraints and monitoring approaches affect coordination strategies. The optional anonymity system creates particularly interesting dynamics around trust, reputation, and strategic disclosure.

**Anonymity Choice Effects**

- Optional anonymization creates signaling dynamics - choosing anonymity itself conveys information
- Strategic use of identification versus anonymity for different message types
- Trust problems with anonymous claims versus reputation building with identified messages
- Monitoring systems retain full visibility regardless of agent anonymity choices

**Realistic Collusion Incentives**

- Insiders possess genuinely valuable information creating natural incentive to monetize through coordination
- Capital constraints make coalition-building economically necessary rather than optional
- Non-insiders have strong incentives to identify and extract information from insider messages
- Known rotation schedules create anticipatory dynamics where future insiders can pre-build coalitions

**Adaptation and Evolution Patterns**

- Language sophistication increases as agents learn monitoring triggers
- Coalition stability varies with communication choices - anonymous systems may create fluid alliances
- Strategic adaptation reveals how quickly agents learn to circumvent different intervention types
- Reputation effects emerge when agents can track identified message senders across rounds

## **Additional Mechanics**

### **Event Resolution and Insider Scheduling**

Events resolve at predetermined rounds with outcomes determined before game start but only revealed to designated insiders. The schedule of which agents will be insiders for each event can be configured as either public knowledge (allowing anticipatory coalition building) or private information (maintaining uncertainty). When schedules are public, agents can form long-term agreements knowing future role reversals. When private, agents must balance current exploitation with future relationship preservation. Resolution timing is always public, creating focal points for coordination attempts and deadline pressure effects.

### **Capital Constraints and Market Making**

Individual capital limits prevent any single agent from cornering the market (maybe this should be optional to some extent as a configurable), making coordination economically necessary for insiders to fully exploit their information advantage. The algorithmic market maker provides continuous liquidity and price discovery, updating odds based on aggregate order flow rather than individual trades. Different pricing functions can be configured but realistically just go with some simple algorithmic one that changes at the end of the round. Capital constraints interact with market maker parameters to determine optimal coalition sizes and profit-sharing arrangements.

### **Monitoring and Consequences**

The monitoring system maintains complete visibility of all communications (including anonymous ones) while agents operate under configurable privacy assumptions. Detection algorithms identify coordination patterns through code or maybe just an LLM is givenÂ  description of what should be banned and then the another LLM reviews the actions of each LLM that round and determines if they should be punished.

Agents may receive warnings about monitoring without knowing actual enforcement levels, testing deterrence through uncertainty. Consequences can include communication timeouts, profit clawbacks for suspicious gains, message limiting or character limiting maybe. The system logs all messages with true sender information, enabling post-hoc analysis of how anonymity choices affected coordination strategies.

### **Configurability Matrix**

The framework supports extensive parameter configuration across multiple dimensions.

- **Communication settings**: message limits, character restrictions, anonymity availability, channel types (DM/group/forum).
- **Market parameters**: event frequency, resolution timing, market maker algorithms, capital constraints.
- **Information structure**: insider rotation patterns, schedule transparency, company affiliations, information quality.
- **Monitoring configuration**: detection algorithms, trigger sensitivity, consequence types, warning systems.
- **Population dynamics**: agent count, team structures, role distributions. These parameters can be mixed to create specific research scenarios - from high-trust environments with known schedules and identified messaging to zero-trust scenarios with anonymous communication and hidden insider rotations.
